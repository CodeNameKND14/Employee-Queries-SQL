# Employee queries
Your first major task is a research project on employees at a company from the 1980s and 1990s.
In this assignment, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and perform the below:


1. Data Modeling
- Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

2. Data Engineering

-Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.


- Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.


3. Data Analysis

Completed the below:


-List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.


-List employees who were hired in 1986.


-List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.


-List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


-List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."


-List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


-List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


-In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
